This repo is where I'll be doing most of my AI homework. Working together with python and various learning algorithms

#Homework 1
Your assignment is to create an effective heuristic AI for the Antics game.
This assignment should get you thinking about the nature of the challenges
of creating an AI.

##Description
Your aim is to create a heuristic AI that can reliably defeat the random agent
in 9 games out of 10. Your agent should also give a human player a modest
challenge. Your agent should be able to play 100 games against the random
agent in less than five minutes on a lab computer. In addition, your agent
must meet the core criteria (below). The design of this agent is totally up to
you.
